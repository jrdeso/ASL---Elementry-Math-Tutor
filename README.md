# ASL---Elementry-Math-Tutor
Created from guidance from CS 228 at the University of Vermont
- Developed a GUI using pygame/python libraries and a “LEAP” motion device to tutor American Sign Language (ASL) digits
- Through a leveling system the user would have the ability to learn the ASL 0-9 digits, and then be tested on elementary addition and     subtraction problems
